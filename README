jQuery plugin for autocomplete 
Could not find a plugin for autocomplete without jQuery UI. 
$(jQuery-selector).autocomplete(values:[array_of_values_for_autocomplete]
There needs to be an element for each text box that has autocomplete and needs an attribute called "autocomplete-for"
Example -
HTML - 
<input id='story-title' placeholder='Story Name' x-webkit-speech>
<div class='autocomplete' autocomplete-for='story-title'></div>

JS 
$('#story-title').autocomplete({values:['Count of Monte Cristo', 'Atlas Shrugged', 'White Fang', 'Moby Dick']});

Plugin creation helped by - {http://www.queness.com/post/112/a-really-simple-jquery-plugin-tutorial}

TODO -
Browser check 
More testing
Instead of creating a HTML element for each autocomplete, have just one and then move it to right below the element for which its the autocomplete
